# knog-usb-utility

Utility similar to "Knog Modemaker" for customising Knog lights, with much more customisability, a much
less user friendly UI, and absolutely no guarantees that it won't cause your light to expload in a ball
of flames.

Only tested with the "Knog Cobber Mid Rear", but will probably work with other lights, you'll need to 
amend the product code check in `LightConfigurationUploader.Download`.

Note that running this (especially with the `--import-from` command line option) will potentially brick your
light. I've used it on several lights and it's worked perfectly every time, but use at your own risk.
